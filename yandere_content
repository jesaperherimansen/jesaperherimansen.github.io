          "So I stumbled on this game and noticed there was no guide written yet. Though the achievements aren't too difficult, 109the steps to lead to them can be awkward and confusing. Not always a bad thing, but it can lead to frustration. Each category is a Day109and following Nightmare together, with exception for the 5th. I would highly suggest playing through on your own without spoiling anything as109this game is quite a delightfully insane experience.10910Cosmetic items such as t-shirts, pants, and hats are just that: cosmetic. They do not give any advantage in terms of gameplay to your character. Yes, they can make your character look cool but this is not an MMORPG and your competitors won’t admire your outfit: They are there just to kill you. Since cosmetic items are sold in exchange for Diamonds, the in-game currency you can buy with real money, and do not provide any real benefits, go easy with them"

          "So that wraps this guide up. I'm pretty happy with the way this turned out. I was going to go for a simple step-by-step,10 but it felt too robotic and that's just not me. Hopefully I didn't over-explain anything. I tried to get pretty clear screenshots, 10 but as you can imagine capturing a precise image at the same time of executing a kill is somewhat tricky. I'm sure there's a reference to Life10 is Strange I could make because of that sentence, but that would be spoilers.10Thank you all so much for stopping by. I hope this guide helps you complete the game. Feel free to leave questions/comments if anything isn't10 as clear as it should be"

          "There are Yukas everywhere. How do you know which is the real one? You can't kill them all. But you can read their names.10You can also wait until everyone goes to class. The Skull symbol that isn't in a classroom? That's your Yuka. This one ended up in the bathroom10 and tried to run. This kill will bring Nightmare 4 to an end.She'll stop at the Principal's Office on the 2nd floor, then go to the Nurse's Office on the10 3rd. I advise the 3rd Floor. Kill her quickly in the hallway and carry her to the door1010However, when there are only a few players left, being in a vehicle will attract attention easily. Here is a perfect tactic: Use vehicles at the beginning to escape from firefights and let other players kill each other. Once there are only 10 players or less left, stop using them and switch to a “sneakier” gameplay"

          "Kill: Victoria IshiharaDay 5. Your last target. As you can clearly see, the two students outside the Nurse's10 Office are going to be a problem. While you wait, you can head down and take the knife. And get some more tea and cake.10Method 1). You can go in after the other Teacher has left and kill Victoria in her office. Leave with the body.10 The girls will get scared, but you can escape down the hallway without getting caught by teachers. Even throw her off the stairs like we 10 did with Yuka. Take her corpse to the garden and bury your last victim. You'll see the shovel on your way.1010So, do not attack other players right after you land on the island. If you get attacked, do not fight back. At this stage, only luck determines which player will beat the other one, not skill. Your goal should be staying away from other players as long as possible and let them kill each other. Sprint to a building or hop into a vehicle and move away from the conflict. You should be collecting loot and preparing for the end game. It is possible to win Free Fire by shooting only once – you need to kill only one player to become the king of the island if you play your cards right"
